## 1.0 Purpose Of This Document

This section is a brief statement of the purpose of this document. It is a description and rationale of the expected operations of the system under development. It is a vehicle for stakeholder discussion and consensus to ensure that the system that is built is operationally feasible. This will briefly describe the contents, intention, and audience. One or two paragraphs will suffice.

## 2.0 Scope of the Project

This short section gives a brief overview of the system to be built. It includes its objectives and a high-level description. It describes what area will be covered and which agencies will be involved, either directly or through interfaces. One or two paragraphs will suffice.

## 3.0 Reference Documents or Items

This optional section is a place to list any supporting documentation used and other resources that are useful in understanding the operations of the system. This could include any documentation of current operations and any strategic plans that drive the goals of the system under development.

## 4.0 Background

Here is a brief description of the current system or situation, how it is used currently, and its drawbacks and limitations. This leads to the reasons for the proposed development and the general approach to improving the system. This is followed by a discussion of the nature of the planned changes and a justification for them.

## 5.0 Concept for the Proposed System

This section describes the concept exploration. It starts with a list and description of the alternative concepts examined. The evaluation and assessment of each alternative follow. This leads to the justification for the selected approach. The operational concept for that selected approach is described here. **This is not a design**, but a high-level, conceptual, operational description. It uses only as much detail as needed to be able to develop meaningful scenarios. In particular, if alternative approaches differ in terms of which agency does what, that will need to be resolved and described. An example would be the question of whether or not a regional signal system will have centralized control.
