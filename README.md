# SmartHome
The concept is to create a smart home system that is fueled by a large language model that will essential function as a home butler. It essential will be an integration between AI and the smart home, as if on e were talking to chatgpt but chatgpt could also turn the lights on and off. The end goal of the project will be to create a local system that is a completely closed system, without going through a third party big tech company. this means that the LLM will be a local LLM, rather than than integrating with openai. the system to be used is "home assistant." We will need to run HA on a local hardware, such as a raspberry pi. This will be the first step in creating our smart home. from there, it will be a matter of creating devices for the smart home and integrating them into our home system.

In the best thing to do once we create the local HA network would then be to create a smart speaker from scratch using an ESP32. We would be able to use that to integrate the local large language model into and have that be the "controller" for our HA dashboard. This would be similar to an amazon alexa, but it would have the power of an AI to speak to.

From that point it would be a matter of integrating devices for the system to work with, such as smart locks, Lights, speakers, blinds shutters, etc...
